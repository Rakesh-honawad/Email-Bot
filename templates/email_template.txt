Dear  {{name}},
I hope this message finds you well.

My name is Rakesh Honawad, and I am a recent graduate with hands-on experience in backend development using Java, Go, and Spring Boot, along with familiarity in AWS and Docker. I am actively seeking entry-level opportunities for the role of Software Development Engineer (SDE) and wanted to reach out to explore if there are any current openings for freshers at {{company}}

I am passionate about building scalable backend systems, and I would be excited to contribute to your organizationâ€™s technical goals while learning from a high-performing team. I have attached my resume for your reference and would truly appreciate any opportunities or guidance you could provide.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of connecting.

Warm regards,
Rakesh Honawad
